<h1>Steven Rosendahl</h1>
<p>
  I'm a developer located in Fort Collins, CO.
  I've been developing professionally since my sophomore year of college, and have worked with languages such as
  JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C#, and C++, frameworks and tools such as Android, Unity, Angular, and React, and
  have worked for companies such as NASA, <a href="https://mynewleaf.co/">MyNewLeaf</a>, and my current company,
  <a href="https://in-situ.com/">In-Situ</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I love to take on new challenges in my day to day work, and would love the opportunity to work with people who are
  driven to make a change in the world. If you have a project that you would like to talk to me about, you can find my
