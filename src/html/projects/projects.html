      Recipiece is a simple online cookbook. Users can store their recipes as either public or private and can easily
      access them through a simple grid view. There are many more planned features.
      Recipiece uses Angular for the application front-end and PostgreSQL/nodeJS for the backend.

      PXV is an RPG that I am currently using to learn Unity. Scripts are written in C#, and maps are made in Tiled.
      I've wanted to learn Unity for a long time, and I love (J)RPG games.

      Coffee Shop
    </h1>
    <p>
      This is a simple coffee shop template-esque website. I like clean and simple layouts, so I elected to use UI Kit
      for its suite of components and its clean look and feel. I made this as an "I want to do something nice and easy"
      project; it's based off of the current website for my favorite coffee shop.

      This website
    </h1>
    <p>
      This website is also a part of my personal portfolio. I wrote it using UIKit, and decided to use the browser's
      built in link-import system to handle navigation rather than using pure links. This helps curb code complexity
      and follows the DRY principal.
