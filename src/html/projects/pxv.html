      I love RPGs. Final Fantasy VII is probably my favorite game of all time; that being said, I've always wanted to
      create my own RPG. I'm using PXV as an excuse to learn Unity, and as a way to build an RPG the way I've always
      wanted. A lot of work goes in to building something like this, and I have a long way to go.

      PXV is built on Unity 2D and C#. I'm using Tiled map editor to make maps.
