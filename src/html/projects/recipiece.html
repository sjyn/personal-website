<h3>Recipiece - A simple recipe application</h3>

    <p>
      I spend a lot of time in the kitchen and I love to find new recipes to try out. Unfortunately, most recipe
      websites
      are ad-ridden and near impossible to use while in the process of baking/cooking.
      Recipiece allows you to store recipes in a neat and easy to find fashion. Users can search through their
      collection,
      and easily add recipes. There's a dark and light mode, and the UI is clean and simple.

      Recipiece uses Docker containers for deployment, and encrypts sensitive information such as user passwords.
      I primarily chose this project so that I could learn how to properly build a "full stack" application.

      Users can easily CRUD recipes, and are presented with easy to follow lists of ingredients and steps for each
      recipe
      they want to view. Future plans include allowing the user to make a meal, which consists of several recipes,
      create shopping lists, and share recipes by "forking" them (yes, I stole that terminology from git).
    </p>
    <p>
      The application is built using Angular for the front-end and NodeJS/PostgreSQL for the backend. Currently,
      Recipiece is hosted on Digital Ocean and uses Nginx for the webserver and Let's Encrypt for the CA.
