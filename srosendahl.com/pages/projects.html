        <h2>Recipiece</h2>
        <p class="project-description">
          Recipeice is an application designed to assist in the baking/cooking process.
          Users can create recipies by hand entering them, or by passing in a URL to a website containing the recipe.
          Operations can be performed on recipes, such as adding the ingredients to a grocery list, scaling the recipe,
          and converting ingredient units between weights and volumes.
          <br/><br/>
          Recipiece is built on an Nginx-Angular-Flask-Mongo stack, and hosted on DigitalOcean.
          Notable thrid party integrations include Chargebee for billing management and Mailersend for automated email services.

        <h2>Fermentation Chamber</h2>
        <p class="project-description">
          This project was an RPi controlled insulated wooden box for fermenting various foods and drinks.
          The board had a small server running on it that could be easily communicated with via a simple client interface.
          Temperature was managed via a relay connected to a heat lamp bulb, and readings were taken from a simple temperature sensor.
          The chamber worked well until the relay busted one day, keeping the heat lamp on and causing the temperature to exceed 120&#176;F.
          Seeing as botulism can take hold of an improperly fermented good, I was forced to dispose of all of the contents and tear down the chamber.
          Eventually, it will be rebuilt with a proper (i.e. not ordered from a shady Chinese Ebay shop) relay.
