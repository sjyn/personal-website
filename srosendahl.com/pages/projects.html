        <h2>Recipiece</h2>
        <p class="project-description">
          Recipeice is an application designed to assist in the baking/cooking process.
          Users can create recipies by hand entering them, or by passing in a URL to a website containing the recipe.
          Operations can be performed on recipes, such as adding the ingredients to a grocery list, scaling the recipe,
          and converting ingredient units between weights and volumes.
          <br/><br/>
          Recipiece is built on an Nginx-Angular-Flask-Mongo stack, and hosted on DigitalOcean.
          Notable thrid party integrations include Chargebee for billing management and Mailersend for automated email services.

        <h2>Fermentation Chamber</h2>
        <p class="project-description">
          This project was an RPi controlled insulated wooden box for fermenting various foods and drinks.
          The board had a small server running on it that could be easily communicated with via a simple client interface.
          Temperature was managed via a relay connected to a heat lamp bulb, and readings were taken from a simple temperature sensor.
          The chamber worked well until the relay busted one day, keeping the heat lamp on and causing the temperature to exceed 120&#176;F.
          Seeing as botulism can take hold of an improperly fermented good, I was forced to dispose of all of the contents and tear down the chamber.
          Eventually, it will be rebuilt with a proper (i.e. not ordered from a shady Chinese Ebay shop) relay.

        <h2>Gloomhaven Printing</h2>
        <p class="project-description">
          I play a board game called Gloomhaven with my friends.
          I also own a fleet of 3D Printers, both FDM and SLA.
          An <a class="contact-link" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3464688">amazing project on thingiverse</a> allowed me to get started, printing all of the cardboard enemies in resin.
          Since we use an app to play the game, we didn't need the damage counter, and that meant I could save some printing waste by adapting the models slightly.
          Then I needed storage for these; I learned OpenSCAD and designed some boxes, and a magnet system to allow the miniatures to sit in the boxes.
          I also discovered <a class="contact-link" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3530085">a magnetic hex system</a> that would spruce up the cardboard map tiles too, so I've added that to my laundry list of tasks towards this project.
          This is an ongoing project, that has required a surprising amount of planning and a not-so-surprising amount of time learning to fix 3D printers.
          <br/>
          Other technologies that I have dabbled in with this project include
          <ul>
            <li>UNIX OS quirks (udev rules, systemctl, etc)</li>
            <li>Docker (compose) to orchestrate multiple instances of OctoPrint on a single physical server and to host a Syncthing server for easy uploading of gcode files to said printers</li>
            <li>Blender to cleanup some of the miniature models</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Other stuff I've played around with and could probably pick up relatively quickly again</h2>
        <p class="project-description">
          Sometimes I play with a technology, more so that I can just know of its existence.
          I am by no mean an expert, but learning things is fun and I'm always up for a challenge.
          Some examples of these include
          <ul>
            <li>Flutter, to spin up a little toy app and see if I could get a google map displaying on both iOS and android from a unified codebase</li>
            <li>C# and Xamarin. A previous job used Xamarin to build cross platform apps, and I figured I'd be a bit more useful if I could help them out</li>
            <li>A small networking-in-C++ application, just to get a better understanding of how that stuff works</li>
            <li>Kotlin instead of Java to build a todo list app in Android. It's a neat language</li>
            <li>Objective-C, because Swift wasn't a thing quite yet. <code>[[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init]</code> is seared into my brain, much like <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code></li>
            <li>Swift, because Objective-C was on its way out (allegedly)</li>
            <li>MongoDB, which was my first database and will always have a special place in my heart</li>
          </ul>
